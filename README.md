### An Explanation

Ultimate RPG is a project i have been steadily working on for the past year. The original goal was to help practice react and javascript skills with 
interesting problems and user interaction but has continually grown beyond my initial expectations. As I built new features more and more ideas would
fill my head and eventually this idea of an infinite and deep RPG system started to take shape. It's still early in it's concept and I'm working on it
solo but i plan on continuing to build and add features to make the Ultimate RPG into a true game.
